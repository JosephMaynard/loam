// Process-global download coordinator for the on-device model manager (Sol P2). EXTRACTED out of
// `model-manager.tsx` so the single-active-download serialization is a MODULE-LEVEL singleton, not a
// per-component-instance `useRef`.
//
// The bug this fixes: the old re-entry guard (`downloadInFlightRef`) and the in-flight controller map
// (`activeDownloads`) were `useRef` values owned by ONE `ModelManagerOverlay` instance. The overlay is
// rendered only inside the `status === 'ready'` branch of `app/index.tsx`, so a host
// `ready → error → ready` transition UNMOUNTS the whole overlay while a download (download → hash →
// persist → cleanup) may still be running, then MOUNTS a fresh overlay whose `downloadInFlightRef` is
// `false` and whose `activeDownloads` is empty. That new instance could start a SECOND concurrent
// download — two large files written at once, two independent storage probes, and a clean-first orphan
// check racing the older transaction's not-yet-created orphan. The module-level orphan `Set` in
// `model-download.ts` prevented URI *overwrite* but did NOT make the transaction process-global.
//
// This coordinator OWNS the one active transaction and its `AbortController` for the transaction's ENTIRE
// lifetime — released ONLY when the transaction's own `finally` settles, never merely because a component
// unmounted. A second caller (a freshly-mounted overlay, or a same-tick double tap) is REFUSED while a
// transaction is active, so at most one download can ever run process-wide. The clean-first orphan step
// (`clearRetainedOrphans`) runs INSIDE the coordinated region, so an old transaction's orphan — created
// even after a new overlay has mounted — is guaranteed to be cleaned before any later download begins.
